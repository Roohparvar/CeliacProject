## Part 1: Metadata Cleaning

To ensure consistency and reliability of downstream analyses, several metadata cleaning steps were performed:

### âœ… Step 1: Corrected Typo in Column Values  
Fixed a typo in the `imm_receptor` column and renamed it to `imm_receptor_Jerome`.

### âœ… Step 2: Updated Clusters  
Updated the `cluster` column in `full_metadata` based on `CellID` matches from `updated_clusters.xlsx`.

### âœ… Step 3: Combined TCR Î± and Î² Chains  
Created `cdr_Full_ab` by combining `a_cdr3` and `b_cdr3` when both were present.

### âœ… Step 4: Combined TCR Î³ and Î´ Chains  
Created `cdr_Full_gd` by combining `g_cdr3` and `d_cdr3` when both were present.

### âœ… Step 5: Combined Ig Heavy and Kappa Chains  
Created `cdr_Full_ig_hk` by combining `h_cdr3` and `k_cdr3` when both were present.

### âœ… Step 6: Combined Ig Heavy and Lambda Chains  
Created `cdr_Full_ig_hL` by combining `h_cdr3` and `l_cdr3` when both were present.

### âœ… Step 7: Reordered Columns  
Reorganized the metadata columns to a predefined, logical order.

### âœ… Step 8: Cleaned B Cell Clusters  
Identified and filtered B cell-related clusters using:

```r
target_clusters <- c(
  "Mast cells", "Plasma cells", "B cells_1", "B cells_2", "B cells MZB1+",
  "Aber. Plasma cells", "Macrophages", "Plasmablast", "B cells BAFFR", "Dendritic cells"
)
```

Removed rows where `imm_receptor` was one of:
```r
c("Aberant ab", "Aberrant g", "gd", "ab")
```

**ðŸ“Œ Removed B cells:** `775`

### âœ… Step 9: Cleaned Non-B Cell Clusters (T Cells)  
Removed rows in non-B cell clusters where `imm_receptor == "hkl"`.

**ðŸ“Œ Removed T cells:** `1459`

### âœ… Step 10: Removed Ambiguous Immune Receptor Assignments  
Filtered out cells with ambiguous `imm_receptor == "T and B"`.

**ðŸ“Œ Removed ambiguous cells:** `1116`

### âœ… Step 11: Computed Clone Size for ab TCRs  
Calculated `clone_size_ab` and `clone_size_bucket_ab` based on the frequency of each `cdr_Full_ab` sequence.

### âœ… Step 12: Computed Clone Size for gd TCRs  
Calculated `clone_size_gd` and `clone_size_bucket_gd` based on the frequency of each `cdr_Full_gd` sequence.

## Part 2: Immune Receptor Distribution

We analyzed how each immune receptor type (`imm_receptor2`) is distributed across different clusters.  
Bar plots were generated to visualize the counts of each receptor type within clusters.  
This analysis helps characterize the immune landscape and receptor usage across cell populations.

## Part 3: TCR Analysis

In this section, we explored the diversity, clonality, and distribution of T cell receptors (TCRs) across clusters.

Key metadata columns used:

- `PatientName`, `Patient`: Sample identifiers
- `a_cdr3`, `b_cdr3`, `g_cdr3`, `d_cdr3`, `h_cdr3`, `k_cdr3`, `l_cdr3`: CDR3 sequences
- `TRAV`, `TRBV`, `TRGV`, `TRDV`: V gene usage
- `TRAJ`, `TRBJ`, `TRGJ`, `TRDJ`: J gene usage
- `contigCount_T`, `file_T`: TCR detection stats and sources
- `imm_receptor2`: Final receptor assignment label
- `cluster`: Cell groupings
- `clone_size_ab`, `clone_size_gd`, `clone_size_bucket_ab`, `clone_size_bucket_gd`: Clonality measures

TCR analysis included:

1. Clone distribution across clusters  
2. V/J gene segment usage  
3. Clonal expansion in disease vs. control  
4. Mapping receptor identity to cell phenotypes
