## ðŸ§¹ Part 1: Metadata Cleaning

Due to some technical noise in the metadata, several cleaning steps were performed to ensure data consistency before downstream analyses.
___

### Step 1: Clean B cell clusters

We identified B cell-related clusters using:

```r
target_clusters <- c(
  "Mast cells", "Plasma cells", "B cells_1", "B cells_2", "B cells MZB1+",
  "Aber. Plasma cells", "Macrophages", "Plasmablast", "B cells BAFFR", "Dendritic cells"
)
```

Then, we removed rows where `imm_receptor` was one of:

```r
target_receptors <- c("Aberant ab", "Aberrant g", "gd", "ab")
```

- âœ… **The number of B cells that were removed: 775**

___

### Step 2: Clean non-B cell clusters (T cells)

For clusters not in the above list, we found rows where `imm_receptor == "hkl"` due to technical noise, and removed those values.

- âœ… **The number of T cells that were removed: 1459**

___

### Step 3: Remove ambiguous "T and B" values

Some cells had `imm_receptor == "T and B"` â€” these were ambiguous and removed as well.

- âœ… **The number of cells with imm_receptor == "T and B" that were removed: 1116**
